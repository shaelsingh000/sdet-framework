\# SDET Automation Framework



\## Overview

This repository contains a production-grade automation framework designed for modern software systems involving web applications, APIs, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines.



The framework is built with scalability, reliability, and maintainability in mind, following real-world SDET practices used in product companies.



---



\## Who This Framework Is For

\- Software Development Engineers in Test (SDET)

\- Automation Engineers working on UI + API testing

\- QA Engineers transitioning into SDET roles

\- Teams working with microservices and CI/CD pipelines



---



\## Problems This Framework Solves



\### 1. Fragmented Testing

Provides a single framework to handle:

\- UI automation

\- API automation

\- Security validation

\- Performance checks



---



\### 2. Flaky and Unreliable Tests

\- Centralized driver and API client management

\- Environment-based configuration

\- Stateless test design



---



\### 3. Poor CI/CD Integration

\- Designed to run seamlessly in GitLab CI

\- Supports headless execution and parallel runs

\- Generates test reports as pipeline artifacts



---



\### 4. Lack of Test Observability

\- Structured logging

\- Failure diagnostics

\- Clear separation of concerns



---



\### 5. Security Blind Spots

\- Security-focused test layer

\- API validation inspired by OWASP principles

\- Supports vulnerability reproduction workflows
